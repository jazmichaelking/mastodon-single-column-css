Being an Internet dinosaur the open and community feel of Mastodon appeals greatly to me, reminding me of the Dark Ages of the 90s when the Internet was fun (remember?), so I wanted to use Mastodon to build a community that appealed to a wide audience including non-techs. First up was simplifying the vanilla Mastodon layout, which is great for some, really hard to use or too busy for others. There is a reasonably vocal component of the existing userbase that is also looking for a single column option, and the answer is generally "use Pinafore".

I believe this poses an unecessary barrier to entry, so I set out to create a single column instance using a vanilla install. https://toot.wales is our working example, and the project goal is to ensure a working single column instance using only the custom CSS option; no file changes, no forks, this should be able to work on a managed host like masto.host

Current Stable: https://toot.wales
Test/Dev: https://toot-test.masto.host

Versions will be numbered to match the vanilla Mastodon version it is known to work with in case you're not in a hurry to upgrade - there will always be prior versions available.

Please add your instance if you use this as your starting point so others can see variations - DM me @jaz@toot.wales
